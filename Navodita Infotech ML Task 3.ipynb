    "**Report: Real-time Object Detection and Tracking Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "The objective of this project is to create a real-time object detection and tracking model that can be applied to various scenarios, such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, or robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation:**\n",
    "1. **Dependencies:**\n",
    "   - Python\n",
    "   - OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)\n",
    "   - SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) Algorithm\n",
    "   - Pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object Detection:**\n",
    "   - We used a pre-trained YOLO model for object detection. YOLO is a deep learning model that can identify objects in images and videos efficiently.\n",
    "   - We loaded the YOLO weights and configuration files to initialize the model.\n",
    "   - OpenCV was used to capture video frames from a source, such as a webcam or video file.\n",
    "   - For each frame, we applied YOLO for object detection.\n",
    "   - The YOLO model provided us with class IDs, confidences, and bounding boxes for detected objects.\n",
    "   - We filtered the detections based on a confidence threshold (adjustable) and retrieved the class IDs and bounding box coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-maximum Suppression:**\n",
    "   - We applied non-maximum suppression (NMS) to eliminate overlapping boxes. This process ensured that we only kept the most confident and non-overlapping detections.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Object Tracking:**\n",
    "   - We used the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm to track objects over time.\n",
    "   - SORT is a tracking algorithm that associates objects in consecutive frames and assigns unique IDs to each object for tracking.\n",
    "   - For each detected object, SORT predicted its position and tracked its movement over time.\n",
    "   - The algorithm handled cases where objects may temporarily disappear or reappear in the video feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization:**\n",
    "   - We drew bounding boxes around the detected and tracked objects, with a unique ID for each tracked object displayed above the box.\n",
    "   - The resulting frames with visualizations were displayed in real-time using OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User Interaction:**\n",
    "   - We provided the option to exit the real-time video feed by pressing the 'Esc' key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "This real-time object detection and tracking model successfully combines YOLO for object detection and the SORT algorithm for object tracking. It can be applied to a wide range of applications, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. The model is capable of detecting and tracking objects in real-time video feeds and providing unique identifiers for each tracked object. Users can further fine-tune the model's parameters, such as confidence thresholds, to adapt it to specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Improvements:**\n",
    "- Optimization for real-time performance and speed.\n",
    "- Integration with external sensors (e.g., lidar, radar) for improved tracking accuracy in autonomous vehicles.\n",
    "- Deployment on edge devices for low-latency applications.\n",
    "- Enhanced user interfaces for customization and real-time monitoring."
